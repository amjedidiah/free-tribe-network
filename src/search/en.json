    "content": "A public health project that seeks to capture and reduce the witnessing of inter-parental violence, and the intergenerational transmission of violence to adolescents. The project aims to improve institutional supportive structures within public secondary schools, to discourage the acceptance or use of violence in future relationships. It combines a powerful blend of research and public health programs to address reproductive health and family well-being.  Identifying the Issue! We observed that Intimate Partner Violence (Inter-parental Violence) had a significant effect on the physical, mental, and social well-being of children and adolescents. Children witnessing these violent behaviours were prone to exhibit difficulties in social interactions, endured emotional strain, and other psychological challenges, building into several negative outcomes such as bullying, unhealthy relationships, low self-esteem, substance abuse, and even criminal behaviours, with effects persisting through adulthood.  Our Approach! The Stand Against Recycled Violence (STAR) Project: an initiative to counter the intergenerational recycling of violence. We combined a powerful blend of research and public health programs, to address the incidence of inter-parental violence, bullying (peer violence), and violence justification. The strategies of the STAR project help us to improve institutional supportive structures within secondary schools, and to discourage the acceptance and use of violence in future relationships.

The network aims to address prevailing issues affecting reproductive health and family health, and to provide sustainable solutions to these problems. It was registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission in 2023, and has since set to create a world where individuals have needed knowledge, resource, and support, for optimal reproductive health and family well-being. Pioneers of the non-profit were graduates students of the Department of Community Medicine, University College Hospital, University of Ibadan; medical professionals, and passionate individuals, who pulled resources to course a plan and structure for the network. To them, FREE is an acronym for Family and Reproductive Health Emancipation and Empowerment. Within the same year of its registration, the organization took the forefront of Reproductive/family health advocacy with programs like ReproMatters , which have seen collaborations with Critical Healthcare Information Integration Network (CHIIN), Girls First Fund, Precious Little Ladies, and others from Harvard and Stanford University. In 2023, the network launched its first pilot project in Ibadan; the Stand Against recycled Violence project, and a social service helpline for telephone support, access to information and referral to family health professionals.",

Data Fragmentation - Without a centralized database of reproductive health (RH) and family health (FH) issues, interventions are often scattered and inefficient, leaving gaps in addressing critical needs. Isolated Communities - Many communities lack access to adequate reproductive and family health resources, leading to feelings of isolation and uncertainty about where to turn for support. Health Inequality - Disparities in access to reproductive and family health resources perpetuate inequalities, leaving marginalized populations at a disadvantage in maintaining their well-being. Stigma and Taboos - Cultural taboos and stigma surrounding reproductive and family health topics prevent open discussion and access to necessary support services, leading to shame and secrecy among affected individuals",
